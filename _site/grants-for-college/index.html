        <p>Education has been and is a pathway out of poverty, yet postsecondary education and skills training are often out of reach for the poor. And because of how our society is set up, the poorest among us tend to be women and people of color.</p>
<p>It is particularly onerous for these women from low-income backgrounds — <a href="/single-mother-statistics/">disproportionately</a> single mothers who survive on a tight budget to get into college.</p>
<p>With today’s higher college costs, <a href="/financial-aid-for-college/">federal student aid</a> is the much needed financial lifeline. For some, it’s the only reason they can complete a degree rather than dropping out of school.</p>
<p>While the federal government is the largest source of aid, <a href="/pell-grant/">primarily in the form of the Pell Grant</a>, state governments often fund grants and scholarships for residents attending college in their state.</p>
<p>Some states — <a href="#california">California</a>, <a href="#wyoming">Wyoming</a> and <a href="#new-jersey">New Jersey</a> — do provide more aid to low-income college students, but most states give far less. Take Michigan, where the average state aid per Pell recipient is only $363. <sup>1</sup></p>
