        <p>Child care can be expensive. The average fee for full-time care ranges from approximately <a href="/cost-of-child-care/">$2,400 to $20,800</a> a year, depending on where the family lives, the type of care, and the age of the child.</p>
<p>The average cost of full-time infant care is most expensive in <a href="/state/massachusetts/">Massachusetts</a> and least expensive in <a href="/state/mississippi/">Mississippi</a>. These costs far exceed what a mother working full-time at the minimum wage typically can afford on her own.</p>
<p>Child Care Assistance Programs (CCAP) — also known as <strong>Child Care Subsidies</strong>, help eligible families with children younger than 13 pay for child care. In cases in which health or other disabilities exist, older children may also be eligible for the program.</p>
<p>The program pays for part of the daycare costs, while parents co-pay for a portion based on the size of the family and the amount of their income.</p>
<p>The list below highlights <strong>Child Care Subsidy Program</strong> offered in each of the 50 states, from Alabama to Wyoming — each with its own eligibility guidelines and application process.</p>
<h3 id="alabama"><a href="https://dhr.alabama.gov/child-care/subsidy-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alabama</a> <a class="direct-link text-gray-400 dark:text-gray-600" href="#alabama" aria-label="permalink to alabama" title="Anchor link for easy sharing.">#</a></h3>
<p>__</p>
<p>Alabama CCAP is the state subsidy program targeted at low-income Alabama families who need help paying for child care. It provides assistance with payment for child care on a sliding fee basis for eligible parents.</p>
<p>Depending on the county you live in, you will need to meet the work requirements and have a child under the age of 13. Some exceptions can be made for those that are disabled.</p>

<p>Child care assistance in Alaska is known as “<strong>Parents Achieving Self Sufficiency</strong>” ( PASS ) and is divided into three categories: <strong>PASS I</strong>, <strong>PASS II</strong>, and <strong>PASS III</strong>.</p>
<p>The PASS I program provides child care assistance for families receiving benefits under the Alaska Temporary Assistance Program. Unlike the other two, PASS I does not require you to contribute toward your child care costs.</p>
<p>PASS II is for those who are transitioning from the Alaska TAP and PASS III is for families who are not eligible for, or who have never received, PASS I or PASS II.</p>
<hr>
<p>If you are already receiving ATAP benefits, contact your case manager or DPA case worker for more information on how to apply for PASS I child care assistance.</p>
<p>Eligibility for PASS II/III child care assistance, on the other hand, is not automatic! You must complete and submit an <a href="http://dhss.alaska.gov/dpa/Pages/ccare/forms.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">application</a> to a local Child Care Assistance office. <sup>2</sup></p>

<p>The Child Care Resource Center (CCRC) in California offers several financial assistance, or subsidy, programs to qualifying families who need help paying for child care.</p>
<p>Families that qualify for the program can choose their own child care provider. The CCRC will reimburse child care providers up to a certain amount.</p>
<p>The child care program in California is administered in three different stages — each with its own set of eligibility criteria.</p>
<p><strong>CalWORKs Stage 1 Child Care</strong></p>
<p>Stage 1 child care is available to CalWORKs families when they first become employed or engaged Welfare-to-Work activities. Each family may be served for up to six months or until the family is stable.</p>
<p><strong>CalWORKs Stage 2 Child Care</strong></p>
<p>Parents may be eligible for Stage 2 child care while they are receiving CalWORKs cash assistance, and for up to 24 months.</p>
<p><strong>CalWORKs Stage 3 Child Care</strong></p>
<p>Stage 3 is available only to families who have received Stage 1 or 2 child care for 24 months after leaving CalWORKs cash assistance, and thus have “timed out” of Stage 2 benefits.</p>
<p>Families remain in Stage 3 until the family’s income exceeds 70% of the state median income or until the children are over the eligibility age.</p>
<hr>
<p>Parents who are employed, participating in a vocational goal or job training, or engaged in other approved activities may also apply for <strong>California Alternative Payment Programs</strong> that provide subsidies to pay for child care.</p>
<p>This subsidized program is available for child care support from birth through twelve years of age. Parents who are incapacitated and families that are homeless may also be eligible.</p>
