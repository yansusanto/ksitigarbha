        <p>爾時地藏菩薩摩訶薩白佛言：「世尊，我承佛如來威神力故，遍百千萬億世界，分是身形，救拔一切業報眾生。若非如來大慈力故，即不能作如是變化。我今又蒙佛付囑，至阿逸多成佛以來，六道眾生，遣令度脫。唯然世尊，願不有慮。」</p>
<p>At that time, Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva, said to Buddha, “World Honored One, relying upon your divine power, I am able to transform myself into many forms to save all beings in billions of worlds from their karmic retribution. If it were not for your benevolent power, I would not be able to transform myself. Now I am again bidden by Buddha to relieve those beings in the six levels. Yes, World Honored One, please do not be concerned.”</p>
<p>爾時佛告地藏菩薩：「一切眾生未解脫者，性識無定，惡習結業，善習結果。為善為惡，逐境而生。輪轉五道，暫無休息，動經塵劫，迷惑障難。如魚游網。將是長流，脫入暫出，又復遭網。以是等輩，吾當憂念。汝既畢是往願，累劫重誓，廣度罪輩，吾復何慮。」</p>
<p>At that time, Buddha Sakyamuni told Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, “Those beings who have not been liberated are very unstable. Bad habits cause karma, good habits caused good fruits, and whether habits are good or bad, beings are all influenced by environment. They transmigrate within the five levels like a wheel turning without stopping. They have been through many hardships for aeons. Like a fish swimming into a net and thinking that it is in a flowing stream, when the fish breaks out from the net, it becomes trapped again. Such beings are what I am always anxious about. But now, you are going to accomplish your vow to help the criminal people. So I have no need for concern.”</p>
<p>說是語時，會中有一菩薩摩訶薩，名定自在王，白佛言：「世尊，地藏菩薩累劫以來，各發何願，今蒙世尊慇懃讚歎。唯願世尊，略而說之。」</p>
<p>When Buddha spoke these words in the meeting, a Bodhisattva, Mahasattva, name Self-Existent King asked, “World Honored One, what vow makes the Buddha praise Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha so much? Please World Honored One tell us.”</p>
<p>爾時世尊告定自在王菩薩：「諦聽諦聽！善思念之！吾當為汝分別解說。乃往過去無量阿僧祇那由他不可說劫，爾時有佛，號一切智成就如來，應供、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊，其佛壽命六萬劫。未出家時為小國王，與一鄰國王為友，同行十善，饒益眾生。其鄰國內所有人民，多造眾惡。二王議計，廣設方便。一王發願，早成佛道，當度是輩，令使無餘。一王發願，若不先度罪苦，令是安樂，得至菩提，我終未願成佛。」</p>
<p>Buddha answered Bodhisattva Self-Existent King, “Listen, listen, and think of what I am about to say. Many aeons ago, there was a Buddha name ‘All-Knowledge-Accomplished One’. This Buddha is worshipped by heavenly beings and people. He has wisdom and is perfect in clarity and conduct. He can be released from life and death. He is omniscient and acts as an advocate and meditator. He is the highest sage and the greatest instructor of heaven and people. That is why this Buddha is respected by heavens and people. The lifespan this Buddha is sixty thousand aeons. He was a king of a small country before he became a monk. While he was a king, he had a good friend who was also a king of a neighbouring country. They both cultivated themselves by doing ten good deeds to help others. The citizens of their countries used to commit many evil acts, so the two kings decided to set up possible ways to help people to give up evil and return to virtue. One king made a vow that he may soon become a Buddha to help all beings. The other king made a different vow, saying that he would never becomes Buddha unless all beings suffering from their criminal acts were saved and gained peace and happiness, attained Bodhi.”</p>
<p>佛告定自在王菩薩：「一王發願早成佛者，即一切智成就如來是。一王發願永度罪苦眾生，未願成佛者，即地藏菩薩是。」</p>
<p>Buddha Sakyamuni told Bodhisattva Self-Existent King, “The king who wished to become a Buddha first is Buddha All-Knowledge Accomplished. The other king who wished to help people but refused to become a Buddha first is the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha.”</p>
<p>「復於過去無量阿僧祇劫，有佛出世，名清淨蓮華目如來，其佛壽命四十劫。像法之中，有一羅漢，福度眾生。因次教化，遇一女人，字曰光目，設食供養。」</p>
<p>“Moreover, long and infinite aeons ago, Buddha Pure-Lotus-Eyes came into the world. This Buddha’s lifespan is forty aeons. The immortal Buddha, Pure-Lotus-Eyes existed during the Dharma-Image Age – at the time when images were used for worship. There was an arhan who instructed many people little by little with his fortunate merits. This arhan met a woman, Bright Eyes, who prepared sacrificial offerings for him.</p>
<p>羅漢問之：「欲願何等？」</p>
<p>The arhan asked her what she wanted.</p>
<p>光目答曰：「我以母亡之日，資福救拔，未知我母生處何趣？」</p>
<p>Bright Eyes answered, “I have prayed and given offerings in memory of my mother since the day she died. I wish to know where my mother is now.”</p>
<p>羅漢愍之，為入定觀，見光目女母墮在惡趣，受極大苦。」</p>
<p>The arhan felt compassion for Bright Eyes. He meditated and saw that her mother had fallen into an evil level and had suffered great pain.</p>
<p>羅漢問光目言：「汝母在生，作何行業？今在惡趣，受極大苦。」</p>
<p>The arhan asked Bright Eyes, “What did your mother do when she was alive? She is now suffering in hell.”</p>
<p>光目答言：「我母所習，唯好食噉魚鱉之屬。所食魚鱉，多食其子，或炒或煮，恣情食噉，計其命數，千萬復倍。尊者慈愍，如何哀救？」</p>
<p>Bright Eyes answered, “My mother loved eating fish, especially baby fish. She fried or boiled thousands of baby fish, willfully, as she pleased. Please nobel one be merciful and help my mother.”</p>
<p>羅漢愍之，為作方便，勸光目言：「汝可志誠念清淨蓮華目如來，兼塑畫形像，存亡獲報。」</p>
<p>The arhan felt compassion for her and advised Bright Eyes, “Reverently recite the name of Buddha Pure-Lotus-Eyes and draw an image of him to benefit all those beings either living or dead.”</p>
<p>光目聞已，即捨所愛，尋畫佛像而供養之，復恭敬心，悲泣瞻禮。忽於夜後，夢見佛身金色晃耀，如須彌山，放大光明。</p>
<p>So Bright Eyes sold all her favorite things as soon as she heard the arhan’s instructions. Then she asked a painter to draw the Buddha’s portrait. She gave offerings in sacrifice, and with a reverent heart sorrowfully wept as she worshiped the Buddha. Unexpectedly one night, as if in a dream, she saw a Buddha who was as tall as Mount Sumeru, emitting bright and shining light.</p>
<p>而告光目：「汝母不久當生汝家，纔覺飢寒，即當言說。」</p>
<p>This Buddha told Bright Eyes, “Your mother will be soon reborn in your house. She will be able to speak soon after she feels hunger and cold.”</p>
<p>其後家內婢生一子，未滿三日，而乃言說。稽首悲泣，告於光目：「生死業緣，果報自受，吾是汝母，久處暗冥。自別汝來，累墮大地獄。蒙汝福力，方得受生。為下賤人，又復短命。壽年十三，更落惡道。汝有何計，令吾脫免？」</p>
<p>After some time, a maidservant of Bright Eyes family bore a baby. This baby could speak three days after her birth. Bowing her head and crying, she told Bright Eyes, “One has to suffer the consequences and retributions of one’s own doing throughout life and death. I was your mother. I stayed in hell for a long time. Since we parted, I have fallen into hell several times. Because of you, I am born here as a servant. But I will die early; I will only live until I am thirteen years old. After I die, I will fall into an evil level again. Do you have any way to relieve me from these sufferings?”</p>
<p>光目聞說，知母無疑，哽咽悲啼而白婢子：「既是我母，合知本罪，作何行業，墮於惡道。」</p>
<p>After listening to the words of the servant’s baby, Bright Eyes realized this baby was her mother. She asked her sorrowfully, and with tears, “When you were my mother, do you know what you did to make you fall into an evil level?”</p>
<p>婢子答言：「以殺害毀罵二業受報。若非蒙福，救拔吾難，以是業故，未合解脫。」</p>
<p>The baby answered, “I am suffering this retribution due to the karma of killing and slandering. If it were not for you saving me from suffering, I would not be released from such karma.”</p>
<p>光目問言：「地獄罪報，其事云何？」婢子答言：「罪苦之事，不忍稱說，百千歲中，卒白難竟。」</p>
<p>Bright Eyes asked about the situation in hell and the baby answered, “It was so horrible that I dare not remind myself of it again. And the sufferings there cannot be stated even in thousands of years.”</p>
<p>光目聞已，啼淚號泣而白空界：「願我之母，永脫地獄，畢十三歲，更無重罪，及歷惡道。十方諸佛慈哀愍我，聽我為母所發廣大誓願。若得我母永離三途及斯下賤，乃至女人之身永劫不受者。願我自今日後，對清淨蓮華目如來像前，卻後百千萬億劫中，應有世界，所有地獄及三惡道諸罪苦眾生，誓願救拔，令離地獄惡趣，畜生餓鬼等，如是罪報等人，盡成佛竟，我然後方成正等正覺。」</p>
<p>Bright Eyes wept and wailed after listening to the baby’s statement. She swore into empty space, “May my mother leave hell forever and not fall into evil again after her thirteen years on earth. Please all Buddhas from the Ten Directions have mercy upon me; listen to my solemn pledge for my mother. If my mother can leave the three evil levels forever, and does not take any humble position or ever be born as woman, I vow, in front of Buddha Pure-Lotus-Eyes that from now on I will save and work towards cultivating all beings in all worlds, hells and evil levels out of suffering. I do not want to become a Buddha until all of them become Buddhas.”</p>
<p>發誓願已，具聞清淨蓮華目如來而告之曰：「光目，汝大慈愍，善能為母發如是大願。吾觀汝母十三歲畢，捨此報已，生為梵志，壽年百歲。過是報後，當生無憂國土，壽命不可計劫。後成佛果，廣度人天，數如恆河沙。」</p>
<p>Bright Eyes then clearly heard Buddha Pure-Lotus- Eyes who told her, “Bright Eyes, you have great benevolent and compassion to make such a great vow for your mother. After your mother finishes thirteen years’ retribution, she will be born into Brahmin class for one hundred years. In her next life, she will again be born into the Land of No Concern for uncountable aeons. Then, she will become a Buddha to help to cross over as many human and heavenly beings as there are sands in the Ganges.”</p>
<p>佛告定自在王：「爾時羅漢福度光目者，即無盡意菩薩是。光目母者，即解脫菩薩是，光目女者即地藏菩薩是。過去久遠劫中，如是慈愍，發恆河沙願，廣度眾生。未來世中，若有男子女人，不行善者行惡者，乃至不信因果者，邪婬妄語者，兩舌惡口者，毀謗大乘者，如是諸業眾生，必墮惡趣。</p>
<p>Buddha told Bodhisattva Self-Existent King, “The arhan who helped Bright Eyes at that time is now the Bodhisattva Inexhaustible-Intention. The mother of Bright Eyes is the Bodhisattva Liberation. And Bright Eyes herself is now the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. Throughout many aeons, Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha has crossed over all beings by his benevolence and compassion. He has made as many vows to rescue living beings as there are grains of sand in the Ganges.”</p>
<p>若遇善知識，勸令一彈指間，歸依地藏菩薩，是諸眾生，即得解脫三惡道報。</p>
<p>“In the future, if any man or woman does not do good deeds, does bad deeds, does not believe in cause and effect, is licentious, uses false and reckless speech, who quarrels a lot, or slander the Mahayana, such people who create this karma must certainly fall into the three evil levels after they die. However, if one meets a wise person who even in the time to take to snap the fingers, and who guides him to take refuge in Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, he will be pardoned for the retributions in the three evil levels.”</p>
<p>若能志心歸敬及瞻禮讚歎，香華衣服，種種珍寶，或復飲食，如是奉事者。未來百千萬億劫中，常在諸天受勝妙樂。若天福盡，下生人間，猶百千劫常為帝王，能憶宿命因果本末。</p>
<p>“If he can respect with all his heart, gaze at, worship and praise, offer fragrant flowers, clothing, food and various kinds of jewellery and valuables to Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha he will enjoy the most wonderful happiness and welfare in heavens for boundless time in the future.”</p>
<p>定自在王！如是地藏菩薩有如此不可思議大威神力，廣利眾生汝等諸菩薩當記是經廣宣流布。」</p>
<p>“Even if his welfare in the heavens has come to an end, he can be born as an emperor for hundreds of thousands of aeons. And he can also remember what happened in his previous life. Bodhisattva Self-Existent King, Ksitigarbha has such a great divine power that will benefit all beings. You, Bodhisattva, keep the sutra in mind and proclaim it extensively.”</p>
<p>定自在王白佛言：「世尊，願不有慮。我等千萬億菩薩摩訶薩，必能承佛威神廣演是經，於閻浮提利益眾生。」</p>
<p>Bodhisattva Self-Existent King answered Buddha, “World Honored One, please do not be concerned. Billions of Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas here will certainly proclaim this sutra around the worlds, and with Buddha’s divine power, help all beings.”</p>
<p>定自在王菩薩白世尊已，合掌恭敬作禮而退。</p>
<p>Bodhisattva Self-Existent King placed both his hands together reverently, bowed and knelt in worship, and withdrew after finishing his statements.</p>
<p>爾時四方天王俱從座起，合掌恭敬白佛言：「世尊，地藏菩薩於久遠劫來，發如是大願，云何至今猶度未絕，更發廣大誓言。唯願世尊為我等說。」</p>
<p>At that time, the Four Heavenly Kings from the east, west, south and north rose from their own seats, placed both hands together respectfully and asked Buddha, “World Honored One, a long time ago Bodhisattva Kishigarbha made a great vow. Why are still many who have not crossed over? Now, he again makes another vow. Please, World Honored One, explain it to us.”</p>
<p>佛告四天王：「善哉善哉！吾今為汝及未來現在天人眾等，廣利益故，說地藏菩薩於娑婆世界，閻浮提內生死道中，慈哀救拔，度脫一切罪苦眾生方便之事。」</p>
<p>Buddha told the four kings, “Excellent, excellent. Now, for your benefit and for the advantage of all beings from heavens and worlds now and in the future, I am going to explain how Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha benevolently helps all beings suffering from their crimes in both life and death in the Saha World, and all the possible ways he uses.”</p>
<p>四天王言：「唯然世尊，願樂欲聞。」</p>
<p>The Four Heavenly Kings said, “Yes, World Honored One, we would like to know.”</p>
<p>佛告四天王：「地藏菩薩久遠劫來，迄至於今，度脫眾生，猶未畢願，慈愍此世罪苦眾生。復觀未來無量劫中，因蔓不斷，以是之故，又發重願。如是菩薩於娑婆世界，閻浮提中，百千萬億方便，而為教化。」</p>
<p>Buddha told the Four Heavenly Kings, “Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha has helped and released all those beings from long time past to now, but he still has not completed his great vow. He has great benevolence and compassion for the suffering beings of this world. Because he observes that the causes of the beings’ karma and retribution are like grass that creep and spread fast, he again takes another strong vow. Therefore, Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha shows billions of convenient ways to help and cultivate all beings in the Saha World.”</p>
<p>四天王，地藏菩薩若遇殺生者，說宿殃短命報。若遇竊盜者，說貧窮苦楚報。若遇邪婬者，說雀鴿鴛鴦報。若遇惡口者，說眷屬鬥諍報。若遇毀謗者，說無舌瘡口報。</p>
<p>“Bodhisattva Kishigarbha persuades those who kill any creature not to kill, otherwise they will die young. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades those who steal things or rob people not to steal or rob, otherwise they will be poor and receive a hard lot. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades those licentious people to give up lustful behavior, otherwise they will be born as birds in future lives. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades those people who have abusive tongues not to speak bad language, otherwise their own relatives will fight with one another. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades those who are fond of slandering others not to libel anyone, otherwise in their future lives they will become mutes or their mouths will ulcerate.”</p>
<p>若遇瞋恚者，說醜陋癃殘報。若遇慳吝者，說所求違願報。若遇飲食無度者，說飢渴咽病報。若遇畋獵恣情者，說驚狂喪命報。若遇悖逆父母者，說天地災殺報。</p>
<p>“Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people with hateful hearts not to hate or be angry with anybody, otherwise in their future lives they will be ugly and crippled. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades mean people to be generous, otherwise their wishes will never be fulfilled. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuaded those people who drink and eat without limitation to control themselves, otherwise they will suffer pain from hunger and thirst and throat diseases. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades those who go hunting willfully to stop hunting, otherwise they will die in terror. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades those who are mean to their own parents to show filial piety or devotion to them, otherwise they will die in natural disasters.”</p>
<p>若遇燒山林木者，說狂迷取死報。若遇前後父母惡毒者，說返生鞭撻現受報。若遇網捕生雛者，說骨肉分離報。若遇毀謗三寶者，說盲聾瘖啞報。若遇輕法慢教者，說永處惡道報。</p>
<p>“Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades those who set fires on mountains, forest or woods never to do that again, otherwise they will die in insanity and confusion. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades step-parents not to torture their step-children, otherwise in their future lives they will be lashed. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to catch fish and birds, otherwise they will lose their own children. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to slander the Three Treasures, otherwise they will become deaf, blind or mute in their future lives. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to disrespect the Dharma, otherwise they will fall into evil levels forever.”</p>
<p>若遇破用常住者，說億劫輪迴地獄報。若遇污梵誣僧者，說永在畜生報。若遇湯火斬斫傷生者，說輪迴遞償報。若遇破戒犯齋者，說禽獸飢餓報。</p>
<p>“Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to destroy anything in the temple, otherwise they will transmigrate among the hells for an endless time. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to insult or falsely accuse monks or nuns, otherwise they will be animals forever in their future lives. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades monks or nuns not to break the Sangha’s rules, otherwise in their future lives they will be animals and they will suffer hungry retribution. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to ruin objects without any reason or use anything which does not belong to them without permission, otherwise they will never obtain what they want.”</p>
<p>若遇非理毀用者，說所求闕絕報。若遇吾我貢高者，說卑使下賤報。若遇兩舌鬥亂者，說無舌百舌報。若遇邪見者，說邊地受生報。</p>
<p>“Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to be proud, otherwise they will be born in low positions and enslaved by others. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to stir up or incite trouble between people, otherwise they will have no tongue or hundreds of tongues as their retribution. Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha persuades people not to argue irrationally or disobey the right way, otherwise they will be born in a barbarous frontier.”</p>
<p>如是等閻浮提眾生，身口意業，惡習結果，百千報應，今粗略說。如是等閻浮提眾生業感差別，地藏菩薩百千方便而教化之。是諸眾生，先受如是等報，後墮地獄，動經劫數，無有出期。是故汝等護人護國，無令是諸眾業迷惑眾生。</p>
<p>“The retributions that I have described in general are what those beings of the worlds cause by their own behaviour, language and consciousness. Because of their different karma, Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha uses many kinds of convenient ways to help and cultivate them. After those beings have finished such retributions, they still fall into hell and there will be no way out for aeons. Therefore, you should protect these living beings and their lands. Do not allow those beings who are confused by their own karma to create more karma.”</p>
<p>四天王聞已，涕淚悲歎合掌而退。</p>
<p>After listening to Buddha’s exhortations, the Four Heavenly Kings sighed, and with tears in their eyes, placed their hands together, and withdrew.</p>
