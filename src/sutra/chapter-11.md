爾時堅牢地神白佛言：「世尊，我從昔來瞻視頂禮無量菩薩摩訶薩，皆是大不可思議神通智慧，廣度眾生。是地藏菩薩摩訶薩，於諸菩薩誓願深重，世尊，是地藏菩薩於閻浮提有大因緣。

At that time, the Earth God Firm and Solid said to Buddha, “World Honored One, I have respected and worshipped limitless Bodhisattvas and Mahasattvas since a long time past. They all possess inconceivable divine power and wisdom to cultivate and help all beings. However, the vow of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva, is deeper and weightier than those of the other Bodhisattvas. World Honored One, this Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, has a close relationship with beings in the worlds.

如文殊、普賢、觀音、彌勒，亦化百千身形，度於六道，其願尚有畢竟。是地藏菩薩教化六道一切眾生，所發誓願劫數，如千百億恆河沙。

Even though Manjushri, Samantabhadra, Avalokiteshvara and Maitreya all have incarnated themselves into hundreds or thousands of forms to cultivate and help those beings in the six level, their vows will be completed one day. However, the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha cultivates and teaches all those beings in six level – the time Ksitigarbha made the great vow to now being hundreds, thousands and billions of aeons.

世尊，我觀未來及現在眾生，於所住處，於南方清潔之地，以土石竹木作其龕室，是中能塑畫，乃至金銀銅鐵，作地藏形像，燒香供養，瞻禮讚歎。是人居處，即得十種利益。何等為十：

World Honored One, as I have observed, if those beings now and in the future find a clean place located in the south of their own house and use earth, stone, bamboo or wood to make a shrine, or make an image of Ksitigarbha out of gold, silver, copper or iron, or paint an image of Ksitigarbha and place it in the shrine, often burn incense in worship and respect, and salute or praise Ksitigarbha, then they can obtain the following ten benefits:

一者、土地豐壤
Their land will be very rich and fertile
二者、家宅永安
Their homes and families will be peaceful forever.
三者、先亡生天
Their ancestors will raised to heaven.
四者、現存益壽
They will enjoy longevity.
五者、所求遂意
They will fulfill their wishes.
六者、無水火災
They will escape floods or fires.
七者、虛耗辟除
They will escape anything that frightens or exhausts them.
八者、杜絕惡夢
They will have no further nightmares.
九者、出入神護
Their every step will be protected by gods.
十者、多遇聖因
They will have many opportunities to encounter the Dharma.

世尊，未來世中，及現在眾生，若能於所住處方面，作如是供養，得如是利益。」

World Honored One, if those beings now and in the future can make such offerings in their own houses, they can obtain these ten benefits.”

復白佛言：「世尊，未來世中，若有善男子善女人，於所住處，有此經典及菩薩像，是人更能轉讀經典，供養菩薩。我常日夜以本神力，衛護是人，乃至水火盜賊，大橫小橫，一切惡事，悉皆消滅。」

The Earth God Firm and Solid continued, “World Honored One, in the future, any good man or woman who can have this sutra and an image of Ksitigarbha in their homes, and who can recite this sutra and make an offering to the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, will be protected and guarded day and night by divine power. Even the risk of flood or fire, robbery, stealing and any evil thing will be eliminated.”

佛告堅牢地神：「汝大神力，諸神少及。何以故？閻浮土地，悉蒙汝護，乃至草木沙石，稻麻竹葦，穀米寶貝，從地而有，皆因汝力。又常稱揚地藏菩薩利益之事。汝之功德，及以神通，百千倍於常分地神。

The Buddha instructed the Earth God Firm and Solid, “The divine power you possess is much greater than that of the other gods. Do you know why? The land in all the worlds is guarded by you. Even every blade of grass, tree, sand, stone, straw, hemp, bamboo, reed, rice or treasure from the ground, grows or is produced by your power. Your constant praise of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha makes your merits, virtues and divine power a thousand times greater than that of ordinary earth-gods’.

若未來世中，有善男子善女人，供養菩薩，及轉讀是經，但依地藏本願經一事修行者。汝以本神力而擁護之，勿令一切災害及不如意事，輒聞於耳，何況令受。非但汝獨護是人故，亦有釋梵眷屬，諸天眷屬，擁護是人。

In the future worlds, if there is any good man or woman who can make offerings to Bodhisattva and recite this sutra to others, as long as he or she practices the rules according to the Ksitigarbha Sutra, you should protect this man or woman by your divine power. Do not allow any disaster or unpleasant thing go through his or her ears, and do not allow them to suffer. Not only will you protect this person yourself, but the retinues of Shakra, Brahma, and the gods of the heavens will also protect them.

何故得如是聖賢擁護，皆由瞻禮地藏形像，及轉讀是本願經故，自然畢竟出離苦海，證涅槃樂。以是之故，得大擁護。」

The reason why this person is protected by many gods is that he or she respects and worships Ksitigarbha’s image and recites this Vow Sutra. These people will removed from the ocean of suffering and will be proof of the bliss of Nirvana.”
