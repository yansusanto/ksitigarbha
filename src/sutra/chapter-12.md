爾時世尊，從頂門上，放百千萬億大毫相光，所謂：白毫相光、大白毫相光、瑞毫相光、大瑞毫相光、玉毫相光、大玉毫相光、紫毫相光、大紫毫相光、青毫相光、大青毫相光、碧毫相光、大碧毫相光、紅毫相光、大紅毫相光、綠毫相光、大綠毫相光、金毫相光、大金毫相光、慶雲毫相光、大慶雲毫相光、千輪毫光、大千輪毫光、寶輪毫光、大寶輪毫光、日輪毫光、大日輪毫光、月輪毫光、大月輪毫光、宮殿毫光、大宮殿毫光、海雲毫光、大海雲毫光。

At that time, the World Honored One emitted hundreds, thousands, millions and billions of light rays from the top of his head, the White Ray, the Great White Ray, the Auspicious Portent Ray, the Great Auspicious Portent Ray, the Jade Ray, the Great Jade Ray, the Purple Ray, the Great Purple Ray, the Blue Ray, the Great Blue Ray, the Azure Ray, the Great Azure Ray, the Red Ray, the Great Red Ray, the Green Ray, the Great Green Ray, the Gold Ray, the Great Gold Ray, the Good Luck Cloud Ray, the Great Good Luck Cloud Ray, the Thousand-Wheeled Ray, the Great Thousand-Wheeled Ray, the Jewelled Ray, the Great Jewelled Ray, the Solar Disc Ray, the Great Solar Disc Ray, the Lunar Disc Ray, the Great Lunar Disc Ray, the Palace Ray, the Great Palace Ray, the Ocean Cloud Ray and the Great Ocean Cloud Ray.

於頂門上放如是等毫相光已，出微妙音，告諸大眾，天龍八部、人非人等：「聽吾今日於忉利天宮，稱揚讚歎地藏菩薩於人天中，利益等事、不思議事、超聖因事、證十地事、畢竟不退阿耨多羅三藐三菩提事。」

And the Buddha again emitted wonderfully subtle sounds and informed all beings, gods, dragons and the others, both human or non-human, “Here in Trayastrimsa Heaven Palace, all listen to me as I glorify the merits that Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha has performed for those in heaven and the human world. This is an inconceivable and super saintly thing. It is his certification of the Tenth Ground – the highest ground of Bodhisattva, and shows us that he will never regress from the Buddhadharma.”

說是語時，會中有一菩薩摩訶薩，名觀世音，從座而起，胡跪合掌白佛言：「世尊，是地藏菩薩摩訶薩具大慈悲，憐愍罪苦眾生，於千萬億世界，化千萬億身。所有功德及不思議威神之力。我聞世尊，與十方無量諸佛，異口同音，讚歎地藏菩薩云：正使過去現在未來諸佛，說其功德，猶不能盡。向者，又蒙世尊，普告大眾：欲稱揚地藏利益等事。唯願世尊，為現在未來一切眾生，稱揚地藏不思議事，令天龍八部，瞻禮獲福。」

At that time, there was a great Bodhisattva, Mahasattva, named Avalokiteshvara. He rose from his seat, then knelt down, placed his hands together and said, “World Honored One, Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva, has a merciful and benevolent heart. He pities the suffering and incarnate himself into billions of different forms to cultivate all beings. All his merits and unimaginable divine power I have heard from the mouths of the World Honored One and limitless Buddhas. Even all the Buddhas now and in the future cannot extol all of Ksitigarbha’s merits. And now, you again want to tell all beings and praise him for all his merits. World Honored One, please speak of the inconceivable divine power of Ksitigarbha. Then allow the gods, dragons and the others to obtain benefits and merits.”

佛告觀世音菩薩：「汝於娑婆世界有大因緣。若天若龍、若男若女、若神若鬼、乃至六道罪苦眾生，聞汝名者、見汝形者、戀慕汝者、讚歎汝者。是諸眾生，於無上道，必不退轉。常生人天，具受妙樂。因果將熟，遇佛受記。汝今具大慈悲，憐愍眾生，及天龍八部，聽吾宣說地藏菩薩不思議利益之事。汝當諦聽，吾今說之。」

The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, “You have a close relationship with the Saha world. If heavenly beings, dragons, men, women, gods, ghosts or all beings suffering from their crimes in the six levels hear your name, see your image, adore you and praise you, they will never regress from the Dharma, and they will always be born in heaven or a human world and enjoy happiness. When their good fruit ripens, they will encounter Buddhas and be prophesied as a future Buddha. Now, having mercy and a kind heart for all heavenly beings, dragons and the others, you come here to listen to my explanation of the inconceivable benefits of the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. You should listen to me carefully. I shall explain this to you.”

觀世音言：「唯然，世尊，願樂欲聞！」

Avalokiteshvara said, “Yes, World Honored One, I will be glad to hear your words.”

佛告觀世音菩薩：「未來現在諸世界中，有天人受天福盡，有五衰相現，或有墮於惡道之者。如是天人，若男若女，當現相時，或見地藏菩薩形像、或聞地藏菩薩名，一瞻一禮。是諸天人，轉增天福，受大快樂，永不墮三惡道報。何況見聞菩薩，以諸香華、衣服、飲食、寶貝、瓔珞，布施供養，所獲功德福利，無量無邊。

The Buddha told Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, “Now and in the future worlds, when the heavenly beings are going to complete their happy life there, they will show five signs of decay. Some will even fall into an evil level. When such heavenly beings, regardless of whether they are male or female show the five weak signs, if they can see Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha’s image, hear Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha’s name, and gaze in worship, they will obtain more merits, enjoy happiness and never fall into the three evil levels. If they see this Bodhisattva and offer him flowers, clothing, food, treasures or jewels, the merits and benefits they gain will be endless and uncountable.

復次觀世音! 若未來現在諸世界中，六道眾生臨命終時，得聞地藏菩薩名，一聲歷耳根者。是諸眾生，永不歷三惡道苦。何況臨命終時，父母眷屬，將是命終人舍宅、財物、寶貝、衣服，塑畫地藏形像。或使病人未終之時，眼耳見聞，知道眷屬將舍宅、寶貝等為其自身塑畫地藏菩薩形像。是人若是業報合受重病者，承斯功德，尋即除愈，壽命增益。是人若是業報命盡，應有一切罪障業障，合墮惡趣者。承斯功德，命終之後，即生人天，受勝妙樂，一切罪障，皆悉消滅。

Moreover, Avalokiteshvara, now and in the future, if those beings in the six levels who are about to die can hear the name of the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha deep in their ears, they will not go through the pain of the three evil levels. If, for example, one sells the house, treasures, possessions and clothing which belong to this person who is about to die, and uses the money to paint or carve an image of Ksitigarbha – or the sick person himself hears or sees that a relative on his behalf has sold his properties to paint or carve a statue of Bodhisattva Kistigarbha for him. If this person’s karma retribution is to suffer a serious illness, then by inheriting these merits, he will recover from illness soon and will live longer. What if this person’s karmic retribution is to fall into the evil levels? By inheriting the merits, his crimes and karma will be eliminated. After he dies he will ascend to heaven and enjoy wonderful happiness. All other crimes will also be eliminated.

復次觀世音菩薩! 若未來世，有男子女人，或乳哺時、或三歲、五歲、十歲以下，亡失父母，乃及亡失兄弟姐妹，是人年既長大，思憶父母及諸眷屬，不知落在何趣、生何世界、生何天中？是人若能塑畫地藏菩薩形像，乃至聞名，一瞻一禮，一日至七日，莫退初心，聞名見形，瞻禮供養。是人眷屬，假因業故，墮惡趣者，計當劫數，承斯男女，兄弟姊妹，塑畫地藏形像，瞻禮功德，尋即解脫，生人天中，受勝妙樂。是人眷屬，如有福力，已生人天，受勝妙樂者，即承斯功德，轉增聖因，受無量樂。

Moreover, Avalokiteshvara, in the future, if there is a man or woman whose parents, or brothers or sisters die; or if when a person was young, was separated from his or her parents or relatives and wonders where they are or to which heaven they have gone; if they can carve or paint an image of the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, or can respect or worship him continuously for seven days, constantly and attentively hearing his name and worshipping, then the accumulated merits will allow this person’s relatives to be relieved from suffering soon, even though this person’s relatives should fall into the evil level for many aeons, and suffer pain because of their karma. The person’s relatives can be reborn in heaven, where they will enjoy wonderful bliss. If the relatives by their own merits have ascended to heaven they will possess Buddha’s wisdom and have endless happiness. If a person can bow and kneel to the image of Ksitigarbha with an attentive heart for twenty one days, and recite his name ten thousand times, the Bodhisattva will appear and tell the person where his relatives have gone. Or, in his dream, he will see the Bodhisattva show great divine power and personally lead him to every world to meet his relatives.”

是人更能三七日中，一心瞻禮地藏形像，念其名字，滿於萬遍。當得菩薩現無邊身，具告是人，眷屬生界。或於夢中，菩薩現大神力，親領是人，於諸世界，見諸眷屬。更能每日念菩薩名千遍，至於千日。是人當得菩薩遣所在土地鬼神，終身衛護，現世衣食豐溢，無諸疾苦。乃至橫事不入其門，何況及身。是人畢竟得菩薩摩頂授記。

“If one can recite the name of Bodhisattva one thousand times a day, continuously for a thousand days, the Bodhisattva will send a god or a ghost to protect and guard him for his whole life and make sure that he lives in affluence. No hardship or sickness will come to him or his house. This person will finally be blesses when Bodhisattva comes to touch his head and predict that he will become a Buddha.”

復次觀世音菩薩! 若未來世有善男子善女人，欲發廣大慈心，救度一切眾生者，欲修無上菩提者，欲出離三界者。是諸人等，見地藏形像，及聞名者，至心歸依，或以香華、衣服、寶貝、飲食，供養瞻禮。是善男女等，所願速成，永無障礙。

Moreover, Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, in the future, when any good man or good woman benevolently makes a vow towards cultivating and helping all beings, wishes to learn about the Dharma and hopes to be released from the three evil level, if that person sees Ksitigarbha’s image, hears his name, follows him with a honest heart or contributes fragrant flowers, clothing, treasures or food in worship, then all their wishes will soon be brought to completion without any obstruction.

復次觀世音! 若未來世，有善男子善女人，欲求現在未來百千萬億等願，百千萬億等事。但當歸依瞻禮、供養讚歎，地藏菩薩形像。如是所願所求，悉皆成就。復願地藏菩薩具大慈悲，永擁護我。是人於睡夢中，即得菩薩摩頂授記。

Moreover, Avalokiteshvara, in the future, when any good man or good woman who make millions of wishes, as long as he or she takes refuge in worships respectfully, offers and praises the image of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, then all wishes and goals can be realized. If he or she makes a vow for Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha to show his great mercy and protect and guard him or her forever, and dreams that Bodhisattva touches his or her head marking a mark, then he or she will finally be a Buddha.

復次觀世音菩薩! 若未來世，善男子善女人，於大乘經典，深生珍重，發不思議心，欲讀欲誦。縱遇明師教視令熟，旋得旋忘，動經年月，不能讀誦。是善男子等，有宿業障，未得消除，故於大乘經典，無讀誦性。如是之人，聞地藏菩薩名、見地藏菩薩像，具以本心恭敬陳白，更以香華、衣服、飲食、一切玩具，供養菩薩。以淨水一盞，經一日一夜安菩薩前，然後合掌請服，回首向南。臨入口時，至心鄭重，服水既畢，慎五辛酒肉，邪婬妄語，及諸殺害，一七日或三七日。是善男子善女人，於睡夢中，具見地藏菩薩現無邊身，於是人處，授灌頂水。其人夢覺，即獲聰明，應是經典，一歷耳根，即當永記，更不忘失一句一偈。

Moreover, Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, in the future, what if a good man or good woman cherishes and reverently reads Mahayana sutras and raises a sincere heart in reading sutras, but even though he or she meets a good teacher, soon forgets the contents of the sutra and cannot read or recite it? This is because this person has karmic obstructions from a former life. This person should tell the Bodhisattva reverently when they hear his name or see his face that they are unable to remember or read the Mahayana sutra. And they should offer flowers, clothing, food or even playthings to the Bodhisattva, prepare a glass of clean water, place it in front of Bodhisattva’s image for one day and night, then place both hands together, ask to drink the water, face the south, and with a sincere and respectful heart, drink the water. After that, be careful not to drink wine, eat meat and the five pungent plants. Do not be licentious, use false speech or kill living creatures. After seven or twenty one days, this good man or good woman will see Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha show his limitless body in their dream. Ksitigarbha will himself anoint their head with water. This person will then be intelligent when he or she awakes. Any sutra he or she hears will be remembered forever; not a single word or sentence will be forgotten.

復次觀世音菩薩! 若未來世，有諸人等，衣食不足，求者乖願、或多病疾、或多凶衰、家宅不安、眷屬分散、或諸橫事，多來忤身，睡夢之間，多有驚怖。如是人等，聞地藏名、見地藏形，至心恭敬，念滿萬遍。是諸不如意事，漸漸消滅，即得安樂、衣食豐益，乃至於睡夢中，悉皆安樂。

Furthermore, Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, in the future, anyone who lacks food or clothing, who cannot obtain the thing he or she wants, who usually falls sick, who always meets evil, whose family is disturbed, who loses his or her relatives, who is often hit by a misfortune or who is terrified in their dreams, they will be gradually removed from those unpleasant things. If they have a reverent and sincere heart when reciting Bodhisattva’s name ten thousand times, or while hearing Kistigarbha’s name or seeing his image, they will also obtain peace, happiness and wealth – even in their dreams.

復次觀世音菩薩! 若未來世，有善男子善女人，或因治生、或因公私、或因生死、或因急事，入山林中、過渡河海、乃及大水、或經險道。是人先當念地藏菩薩名萬遍，所過土地，鬼神衛護，行住坐臥，永保安樂。乃至逢於虎狼師子，一切毒害，不能損之。」

Furthermore, Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, in the future, any good man or good woman who needs to enter a mountain or forest, cross an ocean or river, or pass along a dangerous road for personal or official business in a life or death situation or emergency, should first recite Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha’s name ten thousand times. Then, this place will be protected by gods and ghosts, regardless of whether he or she walks, sits or lies. He or she will surely be peaceful and happy. Even though they meet a tiger, wolf, lion or any other fierce beast, these beasts will be unable to harm them at all.”

佛告觀世音菩薩: 「是地藏菩薩，於閻浮提有大因緣，若說於諸眾生見聞利益等事，百千劫中，說不能盡。是故觀世音，汝以神力流布是經，令娑婆世界眾生，百千萬劫永受安樂。」

The Buddha told Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara, “Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha has a deep relationship with those beings in the worlds. Even through hundreds or thousands of aeons, I still could not convey all the ways he benefits all beings. Therefore, Avalokiteshvara, you should use you divine power to spread this sutra to make sure that all those beings in all worlds can enjoy the merits of peace and happiness through thousands of aeons.”

爾時世尊，而說偈言：「

At that time, World Honored One spoke a verse:

吾觀地藏威神力，恆河沙劫說難盡，見聞瞻禮一念間，利益人天無量事。

“I observe Ksitigarbha’s divine power; like the Ganges sand-like aeons, it cannot be described. To see, to hear, or to worship are all in a thought; endless benefits for humanity and heaven.

若男若女若龍神，報盡應當墮惡道，至心歸依大士身，壽命轉增除罪障。

Men, women, dragons or gods, if by their retributions should fall into evil; sincerely take refuge in Mahasattva, lifespan will increase and karmic obstacles will be eliminated.

少失父母恩愛者，未知魂神在何趣，兄弟姊妹及諸親，生長以來皆不識。

If children lose parent’ love when they are young, and wonder where their spirits are, and they never met brothers, sisters or relatives since they grew up;

或塑或畫大士身，悲戀瞻禮不暫捨，三七日中念其名，

Carve or paint an image of the Mahasattva. Look, worship and adore it without stopping; recite the name from seven to twenty one days,

菩薩當現無邊體，示其眷屬所生界，縱墮惡趣尋出離。若能不退是初心，即獲摩頂受聖記。

Bodhisattva will show his limitless body, show where the relatives have gone; even if fallen onto evil, they will soon escaped.

欲修無上菩提者，乃至出離三界苦。是人既發大悲心，先當瞻禮大士像，

Anyone who wants to follow Bodhi, or be relieved from the suffering of the three levels; this person should raise a great merciful heart,

一切諸願速成就，永無業障能遮止。有人發心念經典，欲度群迷超彼岸，

To gaze at and worship Mahasattva’s image; any wish will come true immediately, and no karma obstacle can stop him.

雖立是願不思議，旋讀旋忘多廢失，斯人有業障惑故，於大乘經不能記。

Anyone who raises his heart to read the sutra hoping to save all beings, although this vow is inconceivable; still the person reads and forgets it soon because of karma obstacles confuse him.

供養地藏以香華，衣服飲食諸玩具，以淨水安大士前，一日一夜求服之，

Offerings of fragrant flowers, clothing, food or any playthings to Ksitigarbha; preparing clean water before the Mahasattva, then to drink after a day and a night.

發殷重心慎五辛，酒肉邪婬及妄語，三七日內勿殺害，

Be careful to avoid the five pungent plants, not to drink wine, eat meat or be licentious, not to kill living beings for twenty one days.

至心思念大士名，即於夢中見無邊，覺來便得利根耳，應是經教歷耳聞，千萬生中永不忘。

Recite Mahasattva’s name reverently, you can see Ksitigarbha in your dream; become intelligent when awakening. From then on, no sutra will be forgotten, never ever forget through thousands of generations.

以是大士不思議，能使斯人獲此慧。

This is caused by Mahasattva’s inconceivable power, which makes this person wise.

貧窮眾生及疾病，家宅凶衰眷屬離。睡夢之中悉不安，求者乖違無稱遂。

Those beings who are poor or sick, a family whose fortune is declining, the people who have uneasy dreams, wishes never come true;

至心瞻禮地藏像，一切惡事皆消滅。至於夢中盡得安，衣食豐饒神鬼護。

Sincerely worship Ksitigarbha’s image, all evil things can be eliminated. Even dreams can be peaceful, clothes and food will be opulent, Gods and ghosts will protect them.

欲入山林及渡海，毒惡禽獸及惡人，惡神惡鬼并惡風，一切諸難諸苦惱。

Anyone who enters the forest or crosses the ocean, afraid of ferocious animals and evil people, all such disaster and distress.

但當瞻禮及供養，地藏菩薩大士像，如是山林大海中，應是諸惡皆消滅。

Gaze at, worship and makes offerings to the image of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva, the evils of the forest and ocean will be eliminated.

觀音至心聽吾說，地藏無盡不思議，百千萬劫說不周，廣宣大士如是力。

Avalokiteshvara, listen to me, Kistigarbha is inconceivable. Through thousands of aeons it cannot be told; proclaim and exalt Mahasattva’s divine power.

地藏名字人若聞，乃至見像瞻禮者, 香華衣服飲食奉，供養百千受妙樂。

Anyone hearing Ksitigarbha’s name, anyone seeing Ksitigarbha’s image and worshipping, offering flowers, clothing or food, will enjoy wonderful pleasure for thousands of aeons.

若能以此迴法界，畢竟成佛超生死。

Dedicating the merits to those beings in the Dharma World, finally become a Buddha, crossing over life and death.

是故觀音汝當知，普告恆沙諸國土。」

Avalokiteshvara, thus you should know and proclaim through the worlds – more numerous than the Ganges’ sands.”
