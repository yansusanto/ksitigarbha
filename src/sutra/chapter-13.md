爾時世尊舉金色臂，又摩地藏菩薩摩訶薩頂，而作是言：「地藏地藏，汝之神力不可思議、汝之慈悲不可思議、汝之智慧不可思議、汝之辯才不可思議，正使十方諸佛，讚歎宣說汝之不思議事，千萬劫中，不能得盡。

At that time, the World Honored One raised his golden arms and touched the head of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva. Then He said, “Ksitigarbha, Ksitigarbha, your divine power is inconceivable. Your benevolent and compassion heart is inconceivable. Your wisdom is inconceivable. Your eloquence is inconceivable. Thousands or millions of aeons is not enough time for the Buddhas from the Ten Directions to explain and praise your inconceivable qualities.

地藏地藏，記吾今日在忉利天中，於百千萬億不可說，不可說，一切諸佛菩薩，天龍八部，大會之中，再以人天諸眾生等，未出三界，在火宅中者，付囑於汝。無令是諸眾生，墮惡趣中，一日一夜，何況更落五無間，及阿鼻地獄，動經千萬億劫，無有出期。

Ksitigarbha, Ksitigarbha, remember what I speak of today in Trayastrimsa Heaven – where thousands, millions and billions of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, heavenly beings, dragons and the others gather together. I request you to help those beings in heavens and worlds who are suffering. Do not let them to fall into evil level even for a single day and night, or fall into the five endless hells and Arbi Hell and suffer hardships for thousands, millions or billions of aeons.

地藏，是南閻浮提眾生，志性無定，習惡者多。縱發善心，須臾即退。若遇惡緣，念念增長。以是之故，吾分是形，百千億化度，隨其根性而度脫之。

Ksitigarbha, those beings of the worlds have unstable minds. They are used to doing evil. Even though they raise a good heart, they soon reject it. If they are in an evil environment, their minds will increase in evil little by little. Therefore, I incarnate hundreds, thousands or billions of forms, according to their personalities, to help and cultivate them.

地藏，吾今殷勤，以天人眾，付囑於汝。未來之世，若有天人，及善男子善女人，於佛法中，種少善根，一毛一塵，一沙一渧，汝以道力，擁護是人，漸修無上，勿令退失。

Ksitigarbha, today, I sincerely entrust multitudes in the heavens and the worlds to you. In the future, if any heavenly being or any good man or good woman in any of the worlds plants a tiny good root in Buddhadharma, even as tiny as a hair, a speck of dust, a grain of sand or a drop of water, you should use your divine power to protect this person. Guide him on the path of Dharma, step by step and never allow him to regress or lose it.”

復次地藏，未來世中，若天若人，隨業報應，落在惡趣。臨墮趣中，或至門首，是諸眾生，若能念得一佛名，一菩薩名，一句一偈大乘經典。是諸眾生，汝以神力，方便救拔，於是人所，現無邊身，為碎地獄，遣令生天，受勝妙樂。」

Moreover, Ksitigarbha, in the future, those heavenly or human beings about to fall into the evil level, if at the front door of hell they can recite a Buddha’s or a Bodhisattva’s name, or a sentence from a Mahayana sutra, you should use your divine power and employ every possible way to help and save them. You can manifest your limitless form around their homes and shatter the hells for them. Let all of them ascend to heaven and enjoy wonderful happiness.”

爾時世尊，而說偈言：

At that time, the World Honored One spoke a verse:

「現在未來天人眾，吾今慇懃付囑汝，以大神通方便度，勿令墮在諸惡趣。」

“Those heavenly beings and humans now and in the future, I sincerely entrust them all to you. Using great divine power to cross them over, do not allow them to fall into the evil levels.”

爾時地藏菩薩摩訶薩，胡跪合掌白佛言：「世尊，唯願世尊不以為慮。未來世中，若有善男子善女人，於佛法中，一念恭敬，我亦百千方便，度脫是人，於生死中速得解脫。何況聞諸善事，念念修行，自然於無上道永不退轉。」

At that time, Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva knelt down, placed his hands together and said to Buddha, “World Honored One, please do not be concerned. In the future, if any good man or good woman shows a little reverence for Buddhadharma, I shall use hundreds or thousands of convenient ways to help and cultivate this person and relieve him or her from suffering. Those people who have studied the Dharma and have heard of good deeds will progress naturally and will never regress from the Way.”

說是語時，會中有一菩薩，名虛空藏，白佛言：「世尊，我自至忉利，聞於如來讚歎地藏菩薩，威神勢力，不可思議。未來世中，若有善男子善女人，乃及一切天龍，聞此經典及地藏名字，或瞻禮形像，得幾種福利？唯願世尊，為未來現在一切眾等，略而說之。」

Present at the meeting while Buddha spoke was a Bodhisattva name Empty Space Store, who asked Buddha, “World Honored One, since I came to Trayastrimsa, I have heard you eulogize the inconceivable divine power of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. In the future, how many benefits may a good man or good woman, and those heavenly beings and dragons who hear this sutra, Ksitigarbha’s name, or worship his image receive? May World Honored One please speak for all those beings now and in the future.”

佛告虛空藏菩薩：「諦聽諦聽！吾當為汝分別說之。若未來世，有善男子善女人，見地藏形像，及聞此經，乃至讀誦，香華飲食，衣服珍寶，布施供養，讚歎瞻禮，得二十八種利益：

The Buddha told Bodhisattva Empty Space Store, “Listen, listen, I shall explain this to you. In the future, any good man or good woman who sees the image of Ksitigarbha or hears this sutra, who recites it and offers fragrant flowers, food, clothing or precious jewellery, and who reverently praises, gazes at and worship him will earn these twenty eight benefits:

復次虛空藏菩薩! 若現在未來，天龍鬼神，聞地藏名，禮地藏形，或聞地藏本願事行，讚歎瞻禮，得七種利益：

Moreover, Bodhisattva Empty Space Store, the heavenly beings, dragons, ghosts or gods now and in the future who hear Ksitigarbha’s name, worship Ksitigarbha’s image or know of Ksitigarbha’s accomplishments, and praise, gaze at and worship him can obtain seven benefits:

一者、速超聖地

爾時，十方一切諸來，不可說不可說諸佛如來，及大菩薩天龍八部，聞釋迦牟尼佛，稱揚讚歎地藏菩薩，大威神力，不可思議，歎未曾有。

Thus, at that time, from Ten Directions, came all the uncountable Buddhas and Great Bodhisattvas, gods, dragons and others to hear Buddha Sakyamuni eulogize the great divine power of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. Such inconceivable divine power had never before been known.

是時，忉利天，雨無量香華，天衣珠瓔，供養釋迦牟尼佛，及地藏菩薩已，一切眾會，俱復瞻禮，合掌而退。

And thus, at that time, boundless fragrant flowers, heavenly garments, treasures and jewels rained down in the Trayastrimsa Heaven as offerings to Buddha Sakyamuni and Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha. All those at the assembly again regarded Buddha with respect, then bowed reverently, placed their hands together, and withdrew.
