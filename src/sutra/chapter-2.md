爾時百千萬億不可思、不可議、不可量、不可說無量阿僧祇世界，所有地獄處，分身地藏菩薩，俱來集在忉利天宮。以如來神力故，各以方面，與諸得解脫從業道出者，亦各有千萬億那由他數，共持香華，來供養佛。

At that time, millions of divinely incarnated forms of Ksitigarbha from inconceivable, uncountable and unutterable worlds and hells came together to Trayastrimsa Heaven Palace. Buddha used his divine power to lead all Bodhisattvas from all worlds, and all those beings released from the hells to come here. Everybody brought flowers to Buddha.

彼諸同來等輩，皆因地藏菩薩教化，永不退轉於阿耨多羅三藐三菩提。是諸眾等，久遠劫來，流浪生死，六道受苦，暫無休息。以地藏菩薩廣大慈悲，深誓願故，各獲果證。既至忉利，心懷踴躍，瞻仰如來，目不暫捨。

These multitudes were those beings whom Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha had instructed, and who would never regress from Buddha’s wisdom. For many aeons, they have floated throughout life and death, suffering in the six levels, with no time to rest. Because of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha’s benevolence and compassion, and his great vow, all had attained a certain level of spiritual development. They came happily to Trayastrimsa and reverently gazed at Buddha.

爾時，世尊舒金色臂，摩百千萬億不可思、不可議、不可量、不可說、無量阿僧祇世界諸分身地藏菩薩摩訶薩頂，而作是言：「吾於五濁惡世，教化如是剛強眾生，令心調伏，捨邪歸正，十有一二，尚惡習在。吾亦分身千百億，廣設方便。或有利根，聞即信受；或有善果，勤勸成就；或有暗鈍，久化方歸；或有業重，不生敬仰。

At that time, World Honored One stretched out his golden arms and touched all the incarnated heads of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva. He said, “I cultivate those hard and violent living beings in the world and in the human condition, subduing their hearts. I hope they can renounce evil and do good deeds. However, one or two-tenths of them still have evil habits. I incarnate myself into billions of forms, and use many convenient ways to save them from suffering. Some of them are very receptive; they believe and practice the Dharma as soon as they hear it. Some of them who have done a few good deeds can become better after I patiently teach and guide them. Some of them are dark and dull – it takes a long time to cultivate them before they will take refuge in the Dharma. Some of them who have heavy karma do not even respect the Triple Gems at all.”

如是等輩眾生，各各差別，分身度脫。或現男子身、或現女人身、或現天龍身、或現神鬼身、或現山林川原、河池泉井，利及於人，悉皆度脫。或現天帝身、或現梵王身、或現轉輪王身、或現居士身、或現國王身、或現宰輔身、或現官屬身、或現比丘、比丘尼、優婆塞、優婆夷身、乃至聲聞、羅漢、辟支佛、菩薩等身、而以化度。非但佛身，獨現其前。

Since such beings have many distinct characters, I always incarnate myself to deliver them from pain and suffering. In order to help them, I incarnate myself in the mountain, forest, stream, plain, river, pond, fountain or well. I show myself not only in the image of Buddha but also in the image of man, woman, heavenly being, dragon, ghost or god. In order to benefit them, I also show myself as an emperor king, Brahma King, Wheel-Turning King, layman, country’s king, prime minister, government official, monk, nun, Sound-Hearer, Arhan, Pratyeka Buddha or Bodhisattva.”

汝觀吾累劫勤苦，度脫如是等難化剛強罪苦眾生。其有未調伏者，隨業報應。若墮惡趣，受大苦時，汝當憶念吾在忉利天宮，殷懃付囑。令娑婆世界，至彌勒出世已來眾生，悉使解脫，永離諸苦，遇佛授記。」

You, Ksitigarbha, have observed that I have diligently worked for a long time to release hard and obstinate suffering criminal beings. As for those who have not improved, if they fall into evil or suffer from past karma retribution, you should remember what I gently taught and repeated to you in Trayastrimsa Heaven Palace – that is, to release all those beings in the Saha World, until the coming of Maitreya, from suffering forever; and to encounter Buddhas and receive the Dharma.”

爾時，諸世界分身地藏菩薩，共復一形，涕淚哀戀，白其佛言：「我從久遠劫來，蒙佛接引，使獲不可思議神力，具大智慧。我所分身，遍滿百千萬億恆河沙世界，每一世界化百千萬億身，每一身度百千萬億人，令歸敬三寶，永離生死，至涅槃樂。但於佛法中所為善事，一毛一渧，一沙一塵，或毫髮許，我漸度脫，使獲大利。唯願世尊，不以後世惡業眾生為慮。」

At that time, all the incarnated forms of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha from many worlds gathered into a single form and said to Buddha tearfully, “I have been instructed by Buddha for long aeons. I have gained inconceivable divine power and wisdom. The boundless worlds are filled with my incarnations. In order to make them take refuge in and respect the Three Treasures, to escape from life and death forever, and achieve Nirvana’s bliss, I have incarnated billions of bodies in every world. Every one I have incarnated has taught hundreds, thousands or billions of people. Even if their good deeds within the Buddhadharma are as little as a hair, a drop, a grain of sand, or a speck of dust, I will gradually save them and make them gain great benefits. Please World Honored One, do not be concerned for those beings in the future.”

如是三白佛言：「唯願世尊，不以後世惡業眾生為慮。」

Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha said to Buddha three times, “Please World Honored One, do not be concerned for future beings with bad karma.”

爾時，佛讚地藏菩薩言：「善哉！善哉！吾助汝喜。汝能成就久遠劫來，發弘誓願，廣度將畢，即證菩提。」

Buddha then praised to Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha and said, “Very good, very good. I am pleased that you have made such a vow. You will achieve your vow and after all have been cultivated and instructed you will attain Bodhi.”
