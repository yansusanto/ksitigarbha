爾時普賢菩薩摩訶薩白地藏菩薩言：「仁者，願為天龍四眾，及未來現在一切眾生，說娑婆世界，及閻浮提罪苦眾生，所受報處，地獄名號，及惡報等事，使未來世末法眾生，知是果報。」

At that time, Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, Mahasattva, said to Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, “Merciful One, would you please explain for the gods, dragons and the Four Heavenly Kings and all beings living in the future and in the present: where all those beings of the Saha World are suffering from their criminal pain, the names of the hells, and the conditions? These answers will let those beings in the future time of the Dharma-Ending Age know of the retributions undergone by the beings of the Saha World.”

地藏答言：「仁者，我今承佛威神，及大士之力，略說地獄名號，及罪報惡報之事。仁者，閻浮提東方有山，號曰鐵圍，其山黑邃，無日月光。

Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha answered, “Merciful One, now, receiving Buddha’s divine power and the Mahasattva’s power, I will explain in general the names of the hells and situations of the retributions. Merciful One, east of this world there is a dark Iron-Fence Mountain. This mountain is black and deep and has neither sunlight nor moonlight.

有大地獄，號極無間，又有地獄，名大阿鼻。復有地獄，名曰四角；復有地獄，名曰飛刀；復有地獄，名曰火箭；復有地獄，名曰夾山；復有地獄，名曰通槍；復有地獄，名曰鐵車；復有地獄，名曰鐵床；復有地獄，名曰鐵牛；復有地獄，名曰鐵衣；復有地獄，名曰千刃；復有地獄，名曰鐵驢；復有地獄，名曰烊銅；復有地獄，名曰抱柱；復有地獄，名曰流火；復有地獄，名曰耕舌；復有地獄，名曰剉首；復有地獄，名曰燒腳；復有地獄，名曰啗眼；復有地獄，名曰鐵丸；復有地獄，名曰諍論；復有地獄，名曰鐵鈇；復有地獄，名曰多瞋。

Within the mountain there is a large hell called Infinite Hell. In this Infinite Hell is another hell named Great Arbi. In this Great Arbi Hell, there are many small hells as follows:

“Four-Cornered Hell, Flying Knife Hell, Flaming Arrow Hell, Crushing Mountains Hell, Piercing Spear Hell, Iron Cart Hell, Iron Bed Hell, Iron Ox Hell, Iron Clothing Hell, Thousand Blades Hell, Iron Donkey Hell, Molten Copper Hell, Holding-Pillar Hell, Flying Fire Hell, Ploughing Tongue Hell, Chopping Head Hell, Burning Leg Hell, Pecking Eye Hell, Iron Pellet Hell, Fighting Hell, Iron Axe Hell, Much Anger Hell.”

地藏白言：仁者，鐵圍之內，有如是等地獄，其數無限。更有叫喚地獄，拔舌地獄，糞尿地獄，銅鎖地獄，火象地獄，火狗地獄，火馬地獄，火牛地獄，火山地獄，火石地獄，火床地獄，火梁地獄，火鷹地獄，鋸牙地獄，剝皮地獄，飲血地獄，燒手地獄，燒腳地獄，倒刺地獄，火屋地獄，鐵屋地獄，火狼地獄。如是等地獄。

Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha said, “Merciful One, such is the unlimited number of hells within the Iron-Fence. In addition, there is the Screaming Hell, Pulling Tongue Hell, Excrement and Urine Hell, Copper Lock Hell, Fire Elephant Hell, Fire Dog Hell, Fire Horse Hell, Fire Ox Hell, Fire Mountain Hell, Fire Stone Hell, Fire Bed Hell, Fire Beam Hell, Fire Eagle Hell, Sawing Teeth Hell, Stripping Skin Hell, Drinking Blood Hell, Burning Hand Hell, Burning Leg Hell, Hanging Thorns Hell, Fire House Hell, Iron House Hell and Fire Wolf Hell.” Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha said, “Merciful One, in the Iron-Fence Mountain, there are infinite hells as such.

其中各各復有諸小地獄，或一、或二、或三、或四、乃至百千，其中名號，各各不同。」

In these hells, there are many small hells with many more different names. One, two, three, four hundred or thousand small hells, and they also have different name.”

地藏菩薩告普賢菩薩言：「仁者，此者皆是南閻浮提行惡眾生，業感如是。業力甚大，能敵須彌，能深巨海，能障聖道。是故眾生莫輕小惡，以為無罪，死後有報，纖毫受之。父子至親，歧路各別，縱然相逢，無肯代受。我今承佛威力，略說地獄罪報之事，唯願仁者暫聽是言。」

Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha told Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, ‘Merciful One, these hells are created by the people themselves who commit these malefactions in all the worlds. The power of karma is so great as to be compared with Mount Sumeru and as deep as the immense ocean. The power of karma can block the way of Buddhadharma. Therefore, do not ignore a minor evil and think that it is guiltless. There is retribution after one dies, even as small as a hair or fibre, and this must be taken. Even the closest relatives, like father and son, have different road. Even meeting, they cannot substitute their retribution for each other. Now relying on Buddha’s divine power, I will give a general explanation of the situation in hell. Please Merciful One listen to me.”

普賢答言：「吾已久知三惡道報，望仁者說，令後世末法一切惡行眾生，聞仁者說，使令歸佛。」

Bodhisattva Samantabhadra answered, “For a long time, I have known of the retributions of the three evil levels. I hope the Merciful One speaks so that all beings who do evil acts in the future of the Dharma-Ending Age rely on and take refuge in the Buddha.”

地藏白言：「仁者，地獄罪報，其事如是。

Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha said, “Merciful One, the following are the retributions of hells:

或有地獄，取罪人舌，使牛耕之。或有地獄取罪人心，夜叉食之。或有地獄，鑊湯盛沸，煮罪人身。或有地獄，赤燒銅柱，使罪人抱。或有地獄，使諸火燒，趁及罪人。或有地獄，一向寒冰。或有地獄，無限糞尿。或有地獄，純飛鈒鑗。或有地獄，多攢火槍。或有地獄，唯撞胸背。或有地獄，但燒手足。或有地獄，盤繳鐵蛇。或有地獄，驅逐鐵狗。或有地獄，盡駕鐵騾。

There is a hell which pulls out a criminal person’s tongue and ploughs it with an ox. There is a hell where a mean devil takes out the criminal person’s heart and eats it. There is a hell where they cook criminal peoples’ bodies in a big cauldron. There is a hell which burns copper pillars and makes criminal persons hold them. There is a hell which uses fire to burn criminal people. There is a hell which is always frozen and icy. There is a hell of endless excrement and urine. There is a hell of flying maces. There is a hell that is full of fire spears. There is a hell in which one’s chest or back are beaten. There is a hell where only hands or legs are burned. There is a hell where iron snakes twist and coil around one. There is a hell where iron dogs chase. There is a hell where all ride on iron donkeys.”

仁者，如是等報，各各獄中，有百千種業道之器，無非是銅是鐵，是石是火，此四種物，眾業行感。若廣說地獄罪報等事，一一獄中，更有百千種苦楚，何況多獄。我今承佛威神及仁者問，略說如是。若廣解說，窮劫不盡。」

“Merciful One, such retributions in every hell use hundreds of thousands of instruments of Karma’s Way. Those instruments are made of copper, iron, stone or fire. The four materials are caused by the heavy karma of beings. It is nearly impossible to explain all the situations in all hells, because there are hundreds or thousands of sufferings in each and every hell. Now, relying on the divine power of Buddha, I have replied to the request from the Merciful One, and I have only explained in general. Even to the end of aeons, there is no end to explaining all the hells in detail.”
