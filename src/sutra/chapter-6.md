爾時世尊舉身放大光明，遍照百千萬億恆河沙等諸佛世界。出大音聲，普告諸佛世界一切諸菩薩摩訶薩，及天、龍、鬼、神、人、非人等。「聽吾今日稱揚讚歎地藏菩薩摩訶薩，於十方世界，現大不可思議威神慈悲之力，救護一切罪苦之事。吾滅度後，汝等諸菩薩大士，及天龍鬼神等，廣作方便，衛護是經，令一切眾生證涅槃樂。」

At that time, the World Honored One emitted bright lights from his body, illuminating the millions of worlds in which Buddhas lived. Buddha Sakyamuni pronounced in a loud voice, informing all the Bodhisattvas, Mahasattvas, in every world, the heavenly beings, dragons, ghosts and gods, humans and non-humans, “Today, listen to me as I glorify Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva. He shows inconceivable, benevolent, and compassionate divine power to help and protect the suffering. After I reach Nirvana, all of you Bodhisattvas, heavenly beings, dragons, ghosts and gods should employ every possible way to protect this sutra in order to allow all beings to obtain Nirvana’s happiness.”

說是語已，會中有一菩薩，名曰普廣，合掌恭敬而白佛言：「今見世尊讚歎地藏菩薩，有如是不可思議大威神德，唯願世尊為未來世末法眾生，宣說地藏菩薩利益人天因果等事，使諸天龍八部，及未來世眾生，頂受佛語。」

After Buddha finished, there was a Bodhisattva named Universally Expansive who placed his hands together and said to Buddha with respect, “Today, World Honored One glorifies Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha who has such unbelievable divine powers and virtues. World Honored One, for the sake of all future beings of the Dharma-Ending Age, please tell us how Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha will benefit people. May gods, dragons, the eight divisions, and all those beings in the future accept Buddha’s instructions.”

爾時世尊告普廣菩薩及四眾等：「諦聽諦聽！吾當為汝略說地藏菩薩利益人天福德之事。」

At that time, the World Honored One said to Bodhisattva Universally Expansive, “Listen, listen. I will explain in general about Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha – how he benefits the human and heavenly beings with his blessings and merit.”

普廣白言：「唯然！世尊，願樂欲聞。」

Bodhisattva Universally Expansive answered, “Yes, World Honored One, we would all be pleased to know.”

佛告普廣菩薩：「未來世中，若有善男子、善女人，聞是地藏菩薩摩訶薩名者，或合掌者、讚歎者、作禮者、戀慕者，是人超越三十劫罪。

Buddha told Bodhisattva Universally Expansive, “In the future world, any good man or good woman when hearing the name of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva, places both hands together, glorifies, bows and admires Ksitigarbha, this person can be relieved of sins from the past thirty aeons.

普廣，若有善男子、善女人，或彩畫形像，或土石膠漆，金銀銅鐵、作此菩薩，一瞻一禮者，是人百返生於三十三天，永不墮於惡道。假如天福盡故，下生人間，猶為國王，不失大利。

Universally Expansive, if any good man or good woman paints Ksitigarbha’s portrait, or using clay, stones, glue, varnish, gold, silver, copper or iron to engrave or erect a statue of Bodhisattva for worship, this person can be born a hundred times in Thirty-Three Heaven and will never fall into the evil levels. Even if his welfare in heaven comes to an end and he is born in the world, he still can be king. That is, he will still have great merits.”

若有女人，厭女人身，盡心供養地藏菩薩畫像，及土石膠漆銅鐵等像，如是日日不退，常以華香、飲食、衣服、繒綵、幢旛、錢、寶物等供養。是善女人，盡此一報女身，百千萬劫，更不生有女人世界，何況復受。除非慈願力故，要受女身，度脫眾生，承斯供養地藏力故，及功德力，百千萬劫不受女身。」

“If there is a woman who dislikes being a woman, she can reverently worship the portrait of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha day after day; or she can offer fragrant flowers, food, clothing, paintings, flags, money or treasures as offerings, and after she ends this life, for hundreds or thousands of aeons she will be born in a world where there exist no women. She will not be born a woman unless she mercifully wishes to be a woman to help and cultivate others. She will inherit the merit power from these offerings to Ksitigarbha and will not be a woman for hundreds or thousands of aeons.”

復次普廣：「若有女人，厭是醜陋，多疾病者，但於地藏像前，志心瞻禮，食頃之間。是人千萬劫中，所受生身，相貌圓滿。是醜陋女人，如不厭女身，即百千萬億生中，常為王女，乃及王妃，宰輔大姓，大長者女，端正受生，諸相圓滿。由志心故，瞻禮地藏菩薩，獲福如是。」

“Again, Universally Expansive, if there is a woman who hates herself, is ugly and constantly ill, she can gaze at and bow in front of Ksitigarbha’s image with sincere devotion, and in a moment she will have a countenance of good fortune. Even though this person does not hate being female, she can be reborn as a king’s, minister’s or virtuous person’s daughter, or a minister’s wife and she will have perfect features. Because she concentrates her heart with sincere devotion, on gazing and bowing to Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, she can gain such merits.”

復次普廣：「若有善男子、善女人，能對菩薩像前，作諸伎樂，及歌詠讚歎，香華供養，乃至勸於一人多人。如是等輩，現在世中及未來世，常得百千鬼神日夜衛護，不令惡事輒聞其耳，何況親受諸橫。」

“Moreover, Universally Expansive, if there is a good man and good woman who can play music or sing to extol before the Bodhisattva’s image, who can offer fragrant flowers or who can persuade one or many people to worship Bodhisattva, such people will be protected by many spirits day and night, and will hear no evil things, not to mention personally experiencing evil things or accidents.”

復次普廣：「未來世中，若有惡人及惡神惡鬼，見有善男子、善女人，歸敬供養讚歎瞻禮地藏菩薩形像，或妄生譏毀，謗無功德及利益事，或露齒笑，或背面非，或勸人共非，或一人非，或多人非，乃至一念生譏毀者。如是之人，賢劫千佛滅度，譏毀之報，尚在阿鼻地獄受極重罪。過是劫已，方受餓鬼。又經千劫，復受畜生。又經千劫，方得人身。縱受人身，貧窮下賤，諸根不具，多被惡業來結其心。不久之間，復墮惡道。是故普廣，譏毀他人供養，尚獲此報，何況別生惡見毀滅。」

“Moreover, Universally Expansive, in the future world, if evil people, evil gods or evil ghosts ridicule or slander that good man or good woman who reverently makes offerings and praises, gazes at and bows to Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha’s image, by saying that this is completely without advantage or merit, or laughs at, or talks behind their backs, or persuades others to slander together, even if they only slander in one thought – the retributions from these peoples’ slanders will be to suffer great pains in Great Arbi for an infinite time. After finishing the sufferings in hell, they will become a hungry ghost. Through a thousand aeons, they will become a human, they will still have a hard life, for example, crippled, weak or poor. Because they are often upset and distressed by the evil karma that twists their hearts, they will again soon fall into evil. Therefore, Universally Expansive, to slander others’ offerings, not to mention having an evil mind to destroy the Dharma, will cause such retributions.”

復次普廣：「若未來世，有男子女人，久處床枕，求生求死，了不可得。或夜夢惡鬼，乃及家親、或遊險道、或多魘寐、共鬼神遊。日月歲深，轉復尪瘵，眠中叫苦，慘悽不樂者。此皆是業道論對，未定輕重，或難捨壽、或不得癒，男女俗眼，不辨是事。

“Moreover, Universally Expansive, in the future, anyone who has a long illness and can neither live nor die, who always dreams of evil ghosts or dead families, or dreams of walking on dangerous roads with spirits and in which these situations continue for months to years, and has a chronic disease, groans in his dreams, and always feels grieved and unhappy, must have done something wrong or evil causing these retributions. This is all due to their past karma road, which is a judgement that has not been decided, and which is not allowing them to die, or to recover either. Most of the ordinary men or women cannot distinguish why these phenomena happen.

但當對諸佛菩薩像前，高聲轉讀此經一遍。或取病人可愛之物，或衣服、寶貝，莊園、舍宅，對病人前，高聲唱言：我某甲等，為是病人對經像前捨諸等物，或供養經像、或造佛菩薩形像、或造塔寺、或燃油燈、或施常住。如是三白病人，遣令聞知。

If anyone suffers from this kind of thing, this sutra should be read once aloud. In addition, one may take favorite article of the sick person, such as clothing, treasures, manors or houses, to give to charity or sell for offering and making Buddhas’ or Bodhisattva’s images. In front of the sick person’s face, he should speak loudly that he would like to give these up on behalf of the sick person. One could also build a temple, light an oil lamp, or donate money to a shrine. Speak this three times in front of the sick person and make sure that he hears what you say clearly.

假令諸識分散，至氣盡者，乃至一日、二日、三日、四日至七日以來。但高聲白，高聲讀經。是人命終之後。宿殃重罪，至於五無間罪，永得解脫，所受生處，常知宿命。

If he has already been in a coma or has breathed his last, you can still speak these words and read this sutra aloud for seven days. Because of this, after the person dies, his past heavy crimes can be released forever, including the five crimes which will lead him to Endless Hell. In his next life, he will always know the things that happened in his former life.

何況善男子善女人自書此經或教人書、或自塑畫菩薩形像乃至教人塑畫。所受果報，必獲大利。

If any good man or good woman writes this sutra by hand or teaches others to write it, or paints or moulds the Bodhisattva’s image or teaches others to paint or mould, he will certainly gain a great deal of merit.

是故普廣，若見有人讀誦是經，乃至一念讚歎是經，或恭敬者。汝須百千方便，勸是等人，勤心莫退，能得未來、現在千萬億不可思議功德。」

Hence, Universally Expansive, if you see anyone read or recite this sutra, praise this sutra even with a single thought or respect this sutra as soon as he hears it, you must use every way to urge them to study hard and not to regress. They can obtain inconceivable merits both now and in the future.”

復次普廣：「若未來世諸眾生等，或夢或寐，見諸鬼神乃及諸形，或悲、或啼、或愁、或嘆、或恐、或怖。此皆是一生十生百生千生過去父母、男女弟妹、夫妻眷屬，在於惡趣，未得出離，無處希望福力救拔，當告宿世骨肉，使作方便，願離惡道。」

“Moreover, Universally Expansive, if those beings in the future dream of many gods, ghosts or even forms, and are always grieving, crying, distressed, sighing, terrified or anxious, they must have relatives from their past lives who have fallen into evil, and these relatives are unable to save themselves and have no way to ask people who have fortune or power for help. You should tell these people to do many convenient things to help their relatives get far away from the evil level.”

普廣，汝以神力，遣是眷屬，令對諸佛菩薩像前，志心自讀此經，或請人讀，其數三遍或七遍。如是惡道眷屬，經聲畢是遍數，當得解脫，乃至夢寐之中，永不復見。

“Moreover, Universally Expansive, using your divine power, you should make those people read this sutra in front of the images of Buddhas or Bodhisattvas. Or ask anyone to recite this sutra three to seven times for themselves. Thus, these relatives who remain in evil can be released after reciting this sutra. And they will never again dream of those spirits.”

復次普廣：「若未來世，有諸下賤等人，或奴或婢，乃至諸不自由之人，覺知宿業，要懺悔者。志心瞻禮地藏菩薩形像，乃至一七日中，念菩薩名，可滿萬遍。如是等人，盡此報後，千萬生中，常生尊貴，更不經三惡道苦。」

“Moreover, Universally Expansive, in the future world, if the people of lower positions, such as servants, slaves or people who are not free, realize the former karma and wish to repent, they may gaze at and bow to Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha’s image, and with sincere devotion recite Ksitigarbha’s name ten thousand times during seven days. Such people after they finish this life will be reborn in noble families for thousands of lives and they will not suffer the pain of evil.”

復次普廣：「若未來世中，閻浮提內，剎利、婆羅門、長者、居士、一切人等，及異姓種族，有新產者，或男或女，七日之中，早與讀誦此不可思議經典，更為念菩薩名，可滿萬遍。是新生子，或男或女，宿有殃報，便得解脫，安樂易養，壽命增長。若是承福生者，轉增安樂，及與壽命。」

“Moreover, Universally Expansive, in future generations around the worlds, no matter what type of people they are, if they recite the inconceivable sutra for seven days for their new born babies, male or female, and again recite Ksitigarbha’s name ten thousand times, these babies will be released from their past retributions, can be easily raised and will enjoy longevity. If the baby is born by his own fortune, his happiness and life will increase.”

復次普廣：「若未來世眾生，於月一日、八日、十四日、十五日、十八日、二十三、二十四、二十八、二十九日、乃至三十日，是諸日等，諸罪結集，定其輕重。南閻浮提眾生，舉止動念，無不是業，無不是罪，何況恣情殺害、竊盜、邪婬、妄語、百千罪狀。

“Moreover, Universally Expansive, if those beings in the future can recite this sutra once in front of any Buddha’s or Bodhisattva’s image during certain ten days including the first, eight, fourteenth, fifteenth, eighteenth, twenty-third, twenty-fourth, twenty-eighth, twenty-ninth and thirtieth days of the lunar calendar, they will be safe, without any disasters. The neighboring families, both young and old, will be far away from evil.

能於是十齋日，對佛菩薩諸賢聖像前，讀是經一遍，東西南北百由旬內，無諸災難。當此居家，若長若幼，現在未來百千歲中，永離惡趣。能於十齋日每轉一遍，現世令此居家無諸橫病，衣食豐溢。

On these certain days the offenses of living beings will gathered together and judged, since all behaviour or thoughts of those in the worlds are karma and an offense – not to speak of such offenses as killing, stealing, debauching or slandering willfully. If people can recite this sutra once a month on the special ten days, their families can be free of every kind of disease and their clothes and food will be opulent

是故普廣，當知地藏菩薩有如是等不可說百千萬億大威神力，利益之事。閻浮眾生，於此大士有大因緣。是諸眾生，聞菩薩名，見菩薩像，乃至聞是經三字五字，或一偈一句者，現在殊妙安樂，未來之世，百千萬生，常得端正，生尊貴家。」

“Universally Expansive, you should know that Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha has such unspeakable, great divine power to benefit all who worship. All beings of the worlds have a deep relationship with this Mahasattva. As long as they hear the Bodhisattva’s name, see the Bodhisattva’s image or listen to a single paragraph, sentence or even a few words from this sutra, they can enjoy wonderful pleasure, peace and happiness today, and be reborn with fine features in noble families in the future million lives.”

爾時普廣菩薩聞佛如來稱揚讚歎地藏菩薩已，胡跪合掌復白佛言：「世尊，我久知是大士有如此不可思議神力，及大誓願力，為未來眾生遣知利益，故問如來，唯然頂受。

At this moment, after listening to the Buddha glorify the Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Bodhisattva Universally Expansive knelt down, placed his hands together and said, “World Honored One, I have known of the great, inconceivable divine power of Bodhisattva’s vow for a long time. In order to make those beings in the future understand the benefits, I therefore ask Buddha and we shall keep this in our hearts.

世尊，當何名此經，使我云何流布？」

World Honored One, what do we call this sutra? And how do we proclaim this sutra?”

佛告普廣：此經有三名：「一名地藏本願，亦名地藏本行，亦名地藏本誓力經。緣此菩薩，久遠劫來，發大重願，利益眾生，是故汝等，依願流布。」

The Buddha said to Universally Expansive, “There are three names for this sutra. One is the Ksitigarbha Vow Sutra, another name is the Ksitigarbha Past Conduct Sutra, the other name is the Ksitigarbha Powerful Vow Sutra. Because so many aeons ago this Bodhisattva took such a great vows to benefit all beings, you should proclaim this sutra in accord with these vows.”

普廣聞已，合掌恭敬作禮而退。

After Bodhisattva Universally Expansive heard this, he placed his hands together, and withdrew.
