爾時地藏菩薩摩訶薩白佛言：「世尊，我今為未來眾生演利益事，於生死中，得大利益，唯願世尊聽我說之。」

At that time, Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, Mahasattva, said to the Buddha, “World Honored One, I am going to speak on the benefits for those beings in the future worlds. Between life and death, they can all receive great benefits. Please World Honored One, hear my word.”

佛告地藏菩薩：「汝今欲興慈悲，救拔一切罪苦六道眾生，演不思議事，今正是時，唯當速說。吾即涅槃，使汝早畢是願，吾亦無憂現在未來一切眾生。」

Buddha told Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha, “At this time you wish to raise your benevolent and merciful heart, to save and cultivate the suffering beings and speak on inconceivable things. Speak quickly because I am about to enter Nirvana. Complete your vow soon, so I need not be concerned for all those beings now and in the future.”

地藏菩薩白佛言：「世尊，過去無量阿僧祇劫，有佛出世，號無邊身如來。若有男子女人聞是佛名，暫生恭敬，即得超越四十劫生死重罪。何況塑畫形像，供養讚歎，其人獲福無量無邊。

Bodhisattva said to the Buddha, “World Honored One, a long time ago, there was a Buddha named Limitless Body. Any man or woman who has heard his name and shows a respectful heart may be pardoned of the heavy crimes of previous and forthcoming aeons. He or she will obtain endless welfare by making offerings or painting images.

又於過去恆河沙劫，有佛出世，號寶性如來。若有男子女人聞是佛名，一彈指頃，發心歸依，是人於無上道永不退轉。

In addition, a long time ago, there was a Buddha in the world named Jewel Nature. If any man or woman hearing his name, and in the snap of fingers makes a wish to take refuge in Buddha Jewel Nature, he or she will never regress from the Buddha’s way.

又於過去有佛出世，號波頭摩勝如來。若有男子、女人，聞是佛名，歷於耳根，是人當得千返生於六欲天中，何況志心稱念。

There was also a Buddha named Lotus Victory. Any man or woman who hears, with the deepest ear, this Buddha’s name, or concentrates on reciting this Buddha’s name can be born in the Six Desire Heaven a thousand times.

又於過去，不可說不可說阿僧祇劫，有佛出世，號師子吼如來。若有男子女人聞是佛名，一念歸依，是人得遇無量諸佛摩頂授記。

Besides, endless time ago, there was a Buddha named Lion Roar, any man or woman hearing his name who can follow this Buddha for one moment, that person will meet uncountable Buddhas, be ordained and be prophesied as a future Buddha.

又於過去有佛出世，號拘留孫佛。若有男子女人，聞是佛名，志心瞻禮或復讚歎，是人於賢劫千佛會中，為大梵王，得授上記。

There was another Buddha named Victorious Contemplation in the past. Any man or woman who hears his name and worships or praises him with utmost mind will be a Brahma King in the assemblies where one thousand Buddhas are gathered and will be ordained and prophesied as a future Buddha.

又於過去有佛出世，號毘婆尸佛。若有男子女人聞是佛名，永不墮惡道，常生人天，受勝妙樂。

There was a Buddha named Visapin in the past. Any man or woman who hears this name will never fall into the evil level and will be born in heaven with the most wonderful pleasure.

又於過去無量無數恆河沙劫，有佛出世，號寶勝如來。若有男子女人聞是佛名，畢竟不墮惡道，常在天上受勝妙樂。

Besides, endless time ago, there was a Buddha named Jewel Victory in the world. Any man or woman hearing this Buddha’s name will never fall into the evil level and will enjoy wonderful happiness.

又於過去有佛出世，號寶相如來。若有男子女人聞是佛名，生恭敬心，是人不久得阿羅漢果。

There was a Buddha named Jewel Appearance. Any man or woman hearing this name who raises a deferential heart will soon earn the Arhanship fruit.

又於過去無量阿僧祇劫，有佛出世，號袈裟幢如來。若有男子女人聞是佛名者，超一百大劫生死之罪。

There was a Buddha named Kasaya Banner in the past world a long time ago. Any man or woman hearing this name can be pardoned of the crimes of life and death for one hundred aeons.

又於過去有佛出世，號大通山王如來。若有男子女人聞是佛名者，是人得遇恆河沙佛廣為說法，必成菩提。

There was another Buddha named Great Penetration Mountain King in the past. Any man or woman who hears this name will meet endless Buddhas to speak Dharma for him or her. And she will surely achieve Bodhi.

又於過去有淨月佛、山王佛、智勝佛、淨名王佛、智成就佛、無上佛、妙聲佛、滿月佛、月面佛有如是等不可說佛。」

There was also innumerable Buddhas in the past, including Buddha Pure Moon, Buddha Mountain King, Buddha Wise Victory, Buddha Pure Name King, Buddha Accomplished Wisdom, Buddha Unsurpassed, Buddha Wonderful Sound, Buddha Full Moon, Buddha Moon Face and so on.”

「世尊，現在未來一切眾生，若天若人，若男若女，但念得一佛名號，功德無量，何況多名。是眾生等，生時死時，自得大利，終不墮惡道。

“World Honored One, the beings, regardless if they are men or women now and in the future, as long as they can recite a Buddha’s name, they will have endless merit. They can obtain still more merit by reciting more Buddha’s names. These people can earn great merit between life and death, and they will not fall into the evil level on earth.

若有臨命終人，家中眷屬，乃至一人，為是病人高聲念一佛名，是命終人，除五無間罪，餘業報等悉得銷滅。

Any relative, even if there is only one relative, who can recite Buddha’s name aloud for the person who is going to die, can allow the person to be pardoned of all karmic retribution except the Five Endless Offenses.

是五無間罪，雖至極重，動經億劫，了不得出，承斯臨命終時，他人為其稱念佛名，於是罪中，亦漸銷滅。何況眾生自稱自念，獲福無量，滅無量罪。」

Though the Five Endless Offenses can make them fall into hell for millions of aeons and not be released, if their relatives recite Buddha’s name for them when they are about to die, or if they recite the names themselves, their offenses can generally also be eliminated. The merit they earn will be uncountable, and their offenses will be eliminated.”
